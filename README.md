## What is MeMeChain?
In other words, MeMeChain is an intriguing experiment exploring the potential future value of MeMe. This experiment is open and accessible to everyone — MeMeChain provides all participants with convenient conditions and a free, decentralized environment to explore. Through this collective experimentation, MeMeChain seeks to discover new paths for the development of memes. The outcomes of these new meme-driven pathways will be shared by all meme holders who take part in the experiment.

## What is MMC？
MMC is MeMeChain's initial native asset. It is not directly issued on the MeMeChain network, but instead is fairly launched on the Solana chain through the Pumpfun platform.
MMC is the core part of MeMeChain’s ‘1 + 1 + ∞’ tokenomic model. Within this tokenomic framework, MMC, as the first experimental coin, plays a central role in two key ways:
First, once the mainnet launches, MMC will be the first asset to bridge to MeMeChain and will serve as the asset that activates the entire network.
Second, node operators must stake MMC in order to run nodes, making MMC the
foundational asset for the operation of the entire MeMeChain network. Other bridged assets will need to be delegated to nodes for staking.

## MeMeChain Advantages
To establish high-performance blockchain infrastructure, MeMeChain has achieved six architectural breakthroughs.

*   **Speed**: Powered by a C/C++-based high-performance framework leveraging cross-platform efficiency, MeMeChain achieves sub-second consensus finality (1s network-wide confirmation), delivering institutional-grade transaction throughput.

*   **Security**: A hybrid security architecture integrates Verifiable Random Function (VRF), Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), ED25519 elliptic curve cryptography, and proprietary SEC protocols. Decentralized node governance eliminates single points of failure.

*   **Scalability**: Dynamic sharding technology and multi-chain parallel processing enable linear throughput scaling. Patent-pending bulk transaction packaging supports enterprise-level application demands.

*   **Immutable Ledger**: A globally node-maintained chained encryption structure ensures transaction irreversibility. Data modifications require 51% node verification, mathematically eliminating tampering vectors.

*   **Full-Chain Transparency**: Real-time transaction synchronization across nodes guarantees complete auditability of address balances and fund flows through decentralized bookkeeping consensus.

*   **Compatibility**: Native support for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) standards enables deep ecosystem interoperability. Developers can migrate dApps with minimal code adjustments, dramatically reducing smart contract deployment barriers.
